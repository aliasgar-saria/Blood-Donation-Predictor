# Blood-Donation-Predictor

The project aims to develop a predictive model to identify potential repeat blood donors using machine learning algorithms.
The model will analyze data from previous blood donations, including time since last donation, number of donations, volume of donated blood, and total months since first donation.

Built a Flask app for predicting blood donation return rates based on donor history using logistic regression, achieving 70% accuracy and 60% F1-score. Addressed imbalance with SMOTE, applied square root transformation, and employed pickle for model serialization. Data gathered from Hsin-Chu, Taiwan.
